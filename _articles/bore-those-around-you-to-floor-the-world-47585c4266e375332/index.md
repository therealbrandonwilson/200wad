One of my heroes is the rapper Gucci Mane. 

  

A common criticism of him are:

_why does he only rap about drugs and killing people?  
why does he only rap about money and bitches?_

  

Basically: _why does he always just talk about the same stuff ?_

  

One of the struggles in my writing journey is this lingering burden that guilts me into creating new things. It causes me to feel bad for not striving to be innovative. This burden however is only palpable when I view myself from other people’s perspective, especially those of my friends and family.

  

Recently, I’ve been on a kind of a high, so I’m better able to exercise awareness of my thoughts rather than simply be consumed by them. And one of the most liberating benefits of such a mindset is clarity in what you want and why.

  

What I want to do, in my writing journey, is to be the best storyteller I can be, telling the stories that I want to tell. And there’s no shame in focusing the hell out of that. It’s only when I begin to lose a grip on my mindset, when I start feeling self conscious, when I can no longer feel good about myself just by myself that I start seeking validation from others. And that’s when I stop listening to myself and begin imagining how others might be viewing me, and thus the burden returns.

  

Associates of Gucci have mentioned during interviews that somewhere in Atlanta there exists hard drives containing enough Gucci Mane music to release several records a year for many decades. Extrapolating from his already-released and enormous canon, I’m guessing the rest of whatever is on those hard drives probably wouldn’t veer far from the usual topics: Bricks. Lean. Molly. Bitches. Bandz. Cars. Rims. Guns. 

  

And that’s why he’s so good at his craft, within his lane. That’s why he’s considered “Trap God”. Nobody ever questioned why MJ practiced his jump shot over a million times. Nobody ever questions why Warren Buffett is reading yet again another report.

  

In the creative domain, and also perhaps the tech domain, there's a heavy emphasis on innovation, when it's something more repetitive and boring that actually ignites 'innovation'.
