In the congested air of an American airport, Deja wondered why the hell a passenger would bring in an entire suitcase full of tea.

I'm telling you! There's something wrong with her!

There's nothing wrong with her. I think she just likes tea.

Robby rested his hands against Deja's shoulders. Thinking it would help calm her down. 

Maybe she just likes tea.

But an entire goddamn suitcase? 

Deja turned to go look back at the passenger from Taiwan who was standing against a wall with a blank stare. Robby went to go look at her. He thought she was attractive. Tall. Somewhere in the mid 30s. Blank stare. Weird, but it made her more attractive to him. He thought about his girlfriend back home. He didn't find her attractive.

Here. Deja. I think that you're just. I mean I think you're letting what happened last week get to you. I really think this woman is simply just bringing back tea. 

Deja throws up her hands and returns to her station, saying something along the lines of, if anything happens, it's all on Robby. 

Robby nods his head and then walks over the woman with a blank stare. As he approaches she shifts to look at him, but the stare remains, though she makes eye contact. 

Hi. Sorry about that. I think you're good to go.

What do you mean? You think I'm good to go? 

I mean that you're good to go. Sorry. You're good to go.

Okay.

Robby leaps over to the suitcase to zip it up for her. She stares down at him as he does this.

It's just tea. 

Robby looks up. Yeah I know. We just. We just have to be careful here you know? TSA. Trying to keep everyone safe! 

He says this with a smile and even shakes his fist while squatted down. It makes him look like a character out of an ad. 

Well, safe travels! Wherever you're going. 

Mm. Thanks. 

After she leaves Robby spends a moment to think about the woman and red suitcase full of golden colored tins. Black Tea she had claimed. From Taiwan. How attractive he had thought. All he had at home was Lipton. He needed to get himself some nice tea. And maybe a nicer girlfriend. 

But all he had at home was Lipton.
