I think I make it out the door by 2 PM. Through the windows it sounded like I was living in the middle of an amusement park. The sound of children having fun and parents watching after them.

  

One more day of this and then things would return to normal. I go to the library intending to just read and surf the web all day, but something about it doesn't feel right. There's more kids in here than usual. Probably overflow from parents taking their kids to the art fair and also the library.
