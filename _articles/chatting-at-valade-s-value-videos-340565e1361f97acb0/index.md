She's a bit older than he had originally imagined upon her entrance when he only saw her figure within her indigo colored rainjacket. She has a soft smile.

Just wondering, you wouldn't know what happened with the Staff Selections.

Oh those? We actually stopped that recently.

Oh no. Such a shame!

Yeah. Actually we're planning on closing soon. We just haven't put the signs up yet, but soon you'll see a big CLOSING SALE posted on this window back here.

She does appear genuinely disappointed. Not in Ivan or the store itself but at the fact of the closing. 

That's really really sad. 

Ivan nods along like it's his duty to. Everyone he's broken the news to so far has acted like the store's closing is a tragedy.

Say I've never seen you in here before. 

Ivan's remark snaps the woman into attention, out of a thought and she smiles more deeply as she stares at him. 

Yeah I've since moved. But there was a time many years ago I used to come to Valade's nearly all the time. This was back before Netflix and all that jazz. Back when I was young of course. And the Staff Selections here were probably the only reason I actually got into film. Something about what the staff here had to suggest, especially a guy named Will, it really spoke to me. But I guess this was all very long ago. Back before your time. 

So where are you now? 

Oh this is going to sound so generic but you know. Just where everyone seems to want to go these days. 

California?

Good guess. Might as well be. But for me it was Denver.

Mm that sounds nice. 

It is. But it's got its own ups and downs. But, hey, is California where you want to move?

Not really. But I think I'll have to. I want to get into film. 

She stares down at his notebook. Mm, so that's what that thing is filled with? Just as she says this, Ivan's phone right next to the notebook begins vibrating.
