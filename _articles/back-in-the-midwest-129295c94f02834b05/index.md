I have now returned back to my idyllic midwestern life. My morning routines and coffee after in the mornings. Programming in the late morning to early afternoon. Dinner with the girlfriend. Reading at night.   

Vacationing in the desert had its perks. The weather was supreme. When we returned back to the Midwest, I felt as though we had just spent a week on a movie set. But the Midwest feels like real life to me. It's what I grown up on as 'real life'. 

Nobody in Arizona seems to be from there. Everyone seemed a transplant. Everytime I ran into someone, the first question that wanted to come out of my throat was, 'how did you end up here. what brought you here'. I felt the same about California.  

For a couple years after college, I felt a pressure to go to a major city. Either the northeast or the west coast. But at this point in my life, I have been able to actualize and live out what I really want, what I've really wanted. And do this with no shame. And this is actually to live in the Midwest haha.

A common argument against living here from some escapees I talk to is that the places where they grew up had nothing to do besides drinking. But I'm really a boring guy. A walk to the farmer's market to pick up some fresh bread and working on my fiction here in the beautiful tree covered Midwest sounds like much more than 'nothing-but-drinking'.
