He could've stopped in along the way to the Urban Dairy to pick up yet another 30 pack of PBR, but the thought of running into someone under those flourescent lights nudged him to walk home instead. There were five cans left in his fridge, which might've been just short of what he wished he had, but enough to not leave him miserable. 

At home he drank next to his desk lamp that revealed the textures of his bedroom wall. He had the laptop open playing a Youtube video, but he wasn't paying attention. He was playing with his can thinking about how much he wished he had just stopped in for a 30 pack. The cans disappeared quite fast. And once they were gone he brushed his teeth and went to bed. He fell asleep maybe four hours later.

The next day he decided to pick up a 30 pack earlier in the day. It was just one pm and he wasn't as worried of running into someone at the liquor store at that time. At that time people mostly came into the Urban Dairy to pick up snacks, donuts, and coffee. He was walking down the street, cars whirling past him to his left, when he crossed paths with a homeless looking man who looked like he didn't fully mature physically smoking a cigarette. 

The smell lingered in his nose as he approached the cracked asphalt parking lot of the Urban Dairy. But the splitting image of the smoker's face stuck with him even longer.
