Let me take a slight detour to talk a bit about this. Loneliness.

Because gangster rap is highly effective at imparting moods and values in short time through symbols and icons... like Versace, AK-47s, weed, Gucci, Armani, Ferrari, Diamonds dancing, foreign bitches, dirty sprite.

I always wondered, what would be my equivalent in the realm of writing. What values and moods am I trying to capture and express. I sometimes would spend months being so influenced by people like Gucci or Future, that I would start forgetting what I'm actually trying to express, forgetting who I actually am, and catching myself deviating more towards not only trying to express the same values the gangster rappers do, but even desiring the same values in my life.

Recently, what I've come realize from watching Future's interviews is that what I'm trying to capture and glorify and beautify is melancholy and loneliness. Just like Future glorified being a drug addict. Just like 50 Cent and Gucci glorified being a thug. I know that my next decade is spent glorifying ennui, melancholy, and loneliness in a life still filled with social wealth and unlimited opportunity. It's great because so many storytellers have already done this. But I get to do it too, and that's all that matters to me. Haha.
