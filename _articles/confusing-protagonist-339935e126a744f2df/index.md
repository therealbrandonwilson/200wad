Ivan returns to trying to somehow finish the ending to his screenplay. It's been a year of him trying to rewrite the same story, unable to figure out why he can never root for his protagonist. No matter how he ends up writing it, the protagonist isn't someone you want to cheer for. 

Lately Ivan considers maybe that that's okay. He just recently re-watched Breaking Bad, and though on the first run he was rooting for Walter White, he found himself unable to do so the second time around. There were indeed more and more examples of the antihero, the unlikeable protagonists coming out. Maybe Ivan's script was just that. 

These were thoughts he likes to play to himself when he grows doubtful. Just that there is one annoying thing. When antiheroes like Walter White take the most horrific course of actions, Ivan still understands why Walter does what he does. There is never a mystery in motive. There may be a disagreement in whether the ends justify the means, but never confusion. 

With his script, Ivan is left wondering why the protagonist acts the way they do. Ivan stares at his messy notebook for a moment feeling tense until he realizes that the woman in the raincoat is standing in front of him.
