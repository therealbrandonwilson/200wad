A quirk I've had for a couple years now is when someone asks me if I'm into writing that I feel the urge to clarify that actually it's not writing I give a shit about but storytelling. And I do this in a very Abe way where I try to point out loudly that writing is just a means to the end. 

But you know after some years building up in this craft I've begun to fall for the means itself and it's become an end itself. 

I now find enjoyment and obtain pleasure from reading the honest words of other people. And I also really like materializing mine. 

The other day when Trisha was telling me that I needed to write a screenplay, I felt less wanting to write that because screenplays aren't complete works in themselves and are rather something that acts as a blueprint to a future creation. 

That moment of aversion made me realize how much I've actually fallen for words. And at this age I guess I'm good with that. I don't know why I was so obsessed with caveating that I'm not a writer and instead a storyteller this whole time. If I had to attribute it to something, it's the thought that writing wasn't sexy enough. It wasn't as cool as music of filmmaking to the younger me.
