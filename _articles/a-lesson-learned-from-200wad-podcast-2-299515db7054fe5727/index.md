@twizzle mentioned how Keni and I sounded like friends in the conversation. And I think we dropped the ball by only talking like friends because it lended to meanderings on topics we wouldn't qualify for the audience. 

My girlfriend said that more structure is needed as this continues. The feeling of friends speaking is wonderful and I want to retain that tone, but I'm going to instill structure so it isn't just a conversation between friends, but a conversation between friends that also brings value to the listener. 

The main pitfalls I recognized when listening back to the convo is how Keni and I would refer to inside-topics that other people wouldn't quite know and delve into the topic without setting an exposition up.

With Daniel, it was my first time speaking with him, so such natural delves were impossible. But with someone I'd previously spoken with like Keni it felt so natural to delve in like friends that I would forget at times that we were recording and supposed to be conversing in a way that would benefit a person trying to write everyday. 

So ongoing, more structure. Keep the warm aire, but underneath have structure.

Just like that toastmaster speaker Keni mentioned was telling a story... but as it unfolded the entire time a point was being made.
