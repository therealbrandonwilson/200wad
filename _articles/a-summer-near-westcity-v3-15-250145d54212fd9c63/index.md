Where to go? With what to fill my belly?

These are the kind of questions you occupy your entire day with if you don't have anything else going on. The mind is expansive. As in it will spend the same amount of energy no matter what it is that it thinks about.Â 

So in my case, I'm not thinking about complex stuff like people with proper jobs, but I am still spending the same amount of energy thinking about meaningless things.... like where to eat. Where should I eat?

I walked over to Chipotle but it was way too crowded. So instead I walked around aimlessly thinking about what to eat.
