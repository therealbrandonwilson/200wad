Putting it on here to document, in case it helps anybody in the future. 

  

12 days ago, I began a brand new overview/outline of a story I've been working on with Joel for over two years. 

It began with probably ~30 pages worth of stream of consciousness writing. 

That led to us trying to make a comic book. So that led to a script. I don't remember how long -- probably ~12 pages. Along with this script, Joel drew like over 20 boxes of comics by hand. 

Then we pivoted and said no comic. Instead, do something with higher quality drawings, but lower amounts of them. And so we decided on something like an illustrated novel for adults. So we wrote some more. This time more stream of consciousness writing. Probably 20-30 pages worth of this. We then ran out of steam. At the time, I just thought we were being lazy.

  

This story takes place in a world I imagined though. A place centered around Westcity. And so I kept writing snippets of experiences and stories involving people in this place. I don't know how many pages worth of this. Maybe like 50?

The whole time I kept thinking about the story Joel and I began. Didn't write for it, but kept thinking.

  

And then about 40 days earlier, I began writing for it again. This time, not full stream of consciousness. About half stream of consciousness / half outlining. That was probably like 8 pages worth of outlining and 18 pages of stream of consciousness.... so I guess not half/half. But more split.

Got some feedback from Chicago Jack. He said what I already knew. But it was still good to hear it. "this isn't an outline" is basically the gist of it. So 12 days ago, i went on the closest thing to Outlining mode that I've ever reached.

And now, I'm finally 55 pages into this outline, and I've figured out what the first domino is. The first irreversible event that sets in motion everything. 

  

If you're reading this, and you're working on something important to you, then this is just an example of how long things can take. If it's important to you, don't give up. And if it's not... make an exit plan to get to where you are doing something important to you.
