I wrote earlier this week of how I knew I wasn't CEO or a leader because I didn't spend most my energy serving others. Because I don't default to trying to understand and instead aim to be understood. 

I also closed out the post saying that it's true that I haven't been a leader from an auditing perspective, but that I noticed it creeping into certain domains of my life.

When I wanted so much to be understood, I fantasized myself already as a leader. With what I know now there's less desiring of anything. This isn't apathy. This isn't disillusionment. I just no longer desire to be a leader any quicker than it outght to come or halt my progression into becoming one in aims to preserve my past. My world is moving forward and part of that means me being and becoming, and I like what I am and appreciate who I was and I'm so grateful for what's to come. 

Simple as that.

As the year and this decade winds down, this is what I realize the me back then would've wanted if only he knew it existed. To be and become... in peace and purpose.

PS I will write about who I used to be if not a leader since I haven't gone into that.
