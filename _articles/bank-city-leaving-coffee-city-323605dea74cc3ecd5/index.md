Having been promised a bountiful plot of fertile land, Dylan's great great grandparents had moved out to Coffee City back when it wasn't called Coffee City with dreams of a bigger life. In the northeast there was no way they could even afford a square inch of land. But out in Coffee City they could have 80 acres. What a dream.

There were many like Dylan's great great grandparents, and almost all of them ended up becoming farmers. With that much land, and that little commerce already happening in the area, what else was there to do? It felt like nothing would become of the vast flat lands besides humble midwestern homesteading, but the homesteaders were wrong. Businesses opened up. Restaurants. Hotels. Banks. There was a bustling main street with shops. It was nothing compared to what they'd left back in the northeast, but it was still the unimaginable.

Unimaginable maybe to the old folks who had literally came on wagons to virgin territory, but to Dylan who was just about graduating high school, he thought it was nothing. There was nothing going on here. He wanted more. And since he had the opportunity at a full ride scholarship at one of the ivy league schools he went.
