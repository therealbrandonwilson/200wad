It's been so long since I've seen you. 

Imogen knew Georgie had been around, but having never seen him it was almost like an irrelevant truth. For the longest time she wondered why he never came into her cafe. It seemed like a place he'd like hanging out in. But now that the cafe's become so busy, she forgot such thoughts until this moment he's appeared in front of her. A novel strangeness sinks in her like the person in front of her is out of place. Not fitting in with the scenery. Only it's not just Georgie who's out of place, it's her. It's the two of them together.

Yeah. I've been around you know. I work at Kransz Mart.

Mm. 

Funny I never see you there.

Imogen laughs innocent, without derision as she says: I don't shop there. I usually go to the Co-op downtown.

All the way in Westcity?

Yeah. Imogen realizes just how odd this might make her appear. I'm a weirdo like that I guess.

Georgie places a lid ontop of the traveler's mug that is now filled with coffee. He shakes his head. 

Not at all. Ivan does that too.
