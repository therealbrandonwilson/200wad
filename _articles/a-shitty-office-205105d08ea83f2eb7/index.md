When I first told my mom about the office the startup founders found, she asked how far it was and I said it was only 8 minutes by car. She said it was very close. 

Everything's far where my parents live so to her 8 minutes is considered very close. But when I think of the office in relation to my apartment it feels far, because I never leave the city of Bloomington, thus anything that's even on the other side of the city feels far. Whereas, while at my parents house, I'm often driving two or three cities over. So even something that's a city away doesn't feel far relatively.

Last evening was my first time in the office. It's a very shitty office. Not shitty as in dingey and squalid. No. It's perfectly fine in those respects. It's shitty in that there is no aesthetic value. No boujee decor. It is a place where you'd expect an accountant with no taste to work out of. 

And I love it. I met the rest of the team for the first time yesterday. And it was in the evening. What were we discussing? Discussing work. Yet it didn't feel like work. And we were in a shitty conference room. And it didn't matter.

This is what Gary Vee was talking about. When he said that he started Vayner Media out of a shitty conference room. I always romanticized his ability to do that. And while I was in bed last night, I was thinking. Hey I'm doing that now.
