Yeah, so unless Keni bans me for some reason, I'll be a judge at this upcoming competition. I'm really excited. I never was excited to write for them and have been waiting to be a judge the whole time, and my time has come! 

But anyways, in case you're curious on how I'll be judging, I'm a real sentimental person. I value your perspective over everything. Grammatical errors and typos don't matter much to me so long as they don't totally derail the reading experience. And also I hate summarizers. 

I'm pumped to be reading everyone's posts. I'll make sure to write a sort of analysis as to my experience having read them to any one that really stands out to me. I'll try my best to try writing about the post in a way that treats the post as its own thing rather than solely my own opinionated take on it. That's something I struggle with. But here's to practicing that. 

Yeah I know Keni's going to hate me, but I'm probably not going to follow her rubric of percentage based grading! America! Freedom!
