During this Thanksgiving break I for the first time obtained clarity into my artistry. Until now, that was one attribute of self awareness I lacked. 

For the past several years I could feel myself chipping away at the surface and getting deeper into clearer and clearer levels of awareness, but artistry was one that I've always struggled with.

A lot of it happens to be because the most influential arts for me happen to express an aesthetic so far from my character. I grew up on action films, Disney love, and gangster rap. And it's been long since those influences stopped being my primary inspiration. 

As I became older I no longer was allured to the kill-em-all action and political drama. I also was no longer enchanted by Disney styled love plots. But gangster rap still stuck around.

Not having enough self awareness of my artistry, my attention was pulled like a dog's into thinking, well if gangster rap is still inspiring to me, then there must be something in that genre that is also me. But it was obvious that the concrete attributes of gangster rap wasn't me. Thank god my inspiration was something so remotely far from myself that I was able to see clearly that there was a difference between them and me. Had my primary influences been something more perceptually me, then I think I might've not been able to reached this level of awareness on my own artistry because I would've been stuck in the mimicry game.

Because I wanted to know what it was about the artistry of gangster rap, I've been studying my favorite artists for some years now. The rappers along the way have been 50 Cent, Drake, Gucci, and now finally the one who made it possible for me the resolve it all: Future.
