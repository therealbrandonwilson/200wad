My favorite post was Gabriel's. I think this community will like Keni's the most. 

Keni's was the most balanced post featuring the most balanced composition of the personal and the predictive/theoretical. 

Most posts leaned too heavily into the predictive/theoretical aspects and thus left out the perspective of the writer themself. 

A few of those posts however did present really intriguing ideas, but the execution of the writing suffered because the words served solely the idea rather than the piece itself as a whole. An example of this is like narrative pieces where people think about or speak about things in such constructed ways that would never happen in those universes except for to serve the purpose of narrating reality to us the outside reader.

I like Gabriel's the most because it was alive and colorful in itself without trying to make grand predictions. Instead the predictive aspect was mostly interpretive via reader. 

However since this is a contest, I need to give the win, based on topic criteria, to Keni. She provides a concise argument, attached to a personal yet relatable perspective. And her argument is also one of the strongest out of all of the entries due to how it cuts through the hardware and other superficial implementation features and instead gets really really really at the driving force of what will actually materialize such things. 

Thanks to everyone who wrote an entry. They were all beautiful to read!
