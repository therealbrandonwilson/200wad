_We want to relate your writing process to who you are as a person, so can we get started with who you are?_

Daniel Miller. Texas transplant, father of three, CTO at a startup in the Multi Family Industry. We develop an application that is a loyalty platform for apartment residents. Cyclist. And writer.

  

_I saw on LinkedIn that you started with a BS in Psychology. So how did you get into your 20 year tech career from Psychology?_

I had intended to go back and get a post-graduate degree, but I had other things in life that took priority for me so I joined the workforce and had the opportunity to get into software when a friend of mine was a manger at a middleware consulting firm offered me a job as a trainee. 

That was the start of it. I spent my first month or two or three, I can't remember how many months, diving into Visual Basic and getting my Microsoft Certified Professional certifications. That was the requirements of that job. For a couple days in the middle of that I thought I'd made a terrible mistake, but I plowed through, got certified, and was able to start consulting on their middleware business. And did a lot of training. 

I'd been into writing before, and in that first tech job was actually when I got the opportunity to participate as a co-author of a technical book on Microsoft's Middleware...

_Yeah I see that. MSMQ From Scratch from 1999?_

Yeah. 

_And you also wrote something that wasn't technical. So you've been writing for a long time. I see 'I am Relevant'_

Correct. So after the internet bubble burst of 2000-2001, the ripple effect made its way out even to enterprise software, which is what I was involved in. It's a long story, but I was laid off then immediately hired as a contractor, and that contract ended. And in that time I decided to pursue writing more seriously. And that's how I got involved in 'I am Relevant'. I can't remember how I got involved. I think they just had a call for authors, because there's like seven authors on that book. There's a bunch of writers for magazines, and I was writing for magazines at the time.

_So when did you start writing for magazines?_ 

Right around then. 2000 - 2001.

_Okay. Yeah, so on your blog danielsjourney.com. There's so much content!_

Yeah, there's over 3000 posts. Hang on I can look. 

_Yeah I can see that the copyright extends to 2001 so that makes sense._

Yeah 2001 is when I started, and I've moved blogging platforms like 10 times, half of those I'd built myself. And posts... hmmm, there are 3388 posts on my blog.

_Oh my gosh. That's a lot. Cause on 200WaD I have just around 10 percent of that so you are a veteran on this regular writing game._

A lot of that was before Twitter, back when web logs were short posts, possibly just a link you found. So the further back you go, the shorter the posts get. And before Twitter, I was on Twitter from early on to about 3.5 years ago, and I had like 14 thousand tweets, so that took a big chunk. Now I've been going back and pruning old posts with dead links, so it's probably only around 1500 substantial posts.

_So you started writing that blog 2001, so I'm guessing you were writing before that while in college? Besides for classes. Were you like writing fiction, non-fiction stuff?_

Maybe. I don't remember. I was definitely writing fiction in high school. And I probably had enough to write in school for college. Then started writing again more non-fiction and also a lot of fiction when I started blogging.

_I actually didn't get to see a lot of fiction on the blog. It seemed mostly like philosophy, journaling, sharing other stuff._

Yeah. It was mostly like my public notebook. If you go back far enough then there's fiction like I'm publishing on 200WaD, it's serialized so it's like 200 words a day but you have to go back pretty far. But the current thing that I'm trying to wrap up here on 200WaD -- the vampire story -- is from that era. I just never published it.

_Yeah just read the post in the middle of the series describing inconsistencies in time in the series. So it's cause you revived it from this old thing._

It's cause I copied and pasted it from old documents. Then after I published it, when I got to the end of the small amount I had written back in 2001, then I realized that there was this continuity error, So I had to fix it in-post.

_So a lot of 200WaD, writers usually either write mostly all fiction or non-fiction, but you seem to do a good split of both. Can you tell us what each one does for you?_

I got into 200WaD to try to get back into fiction writing, but there's more to fiction than just sitting down on the computer and typing. My first story on 200WaD was kind of just like that, but now I have to go back and edit, but that's the part I struggle with. And so the same with this vampire collection, it took a lot of thinking through, so I use a flow chart to determine what all the different segments are going to be on it.

_Speaking of flow charts and writing fiction, is that a common thing you do? Like can you tell us more about your process?_ 

The flow chart started with the first piece I wrote for 200WaD because I was jumping around the timeline so much. And it made sense in my mind, but I quickly realized that I might be off the rails... and I started losing track of where on the timeline certain bits were. So I had to create a timeline and then put all the parts I'd written on the timeline and figure out how I was going to tie all that back together. So I used a flowcharting tool called Whimsical. The same with the vampire story, I was using Whimsical.

The continuity error was the narrator was talking about the present from the past, but I realized I made him 150 years old so the present year had to be 2100... which is not the present. So this is a little bit of a stretch of my skills, to think about someone living in 2100 as opposed to the present. Most of my fiction is off the cuff, from my experience.

_I know what you mean. But it actually reads really well as a recounting of the past. Everyone should check out this series. Kipper Vam Beethoven. It's really cool cause it's about a vampire born in 1950 who comes into age and figures out how to live in this world and not get found out as a vampire... falling in love... but it's rooted in today's societal issues. Main ones being capital inequality and environmental crisis._ 

Yeah. Those are the top of line topics in the current day. And I'm a little hesitant to make predictions about where those issues might be headed.

_When you write fiction, do you feel as if that's in-line with making predictions?_

I don't usually write futuristic stuff. So this is my first foray in to that... well no that's not true. I wrote a thing for a magazine in the UK ten years ago. I should republish it on 200WaD when I have a day where I don't know what to write. It was basically a post apocalypse where what if we learned all the lessons we'd learned from internet and technology, but what if we didn't have the actual technology anymore. It was just a three parter. 

So only Kipper vam Beethoven and the Post Apocalyptic one -- can't remember what it was called -- was the times when I ventured into the futuristic genre, and I'm pretty hesitant to do so.

_Got ya. So you're more naturally into off the cuff things... Sort of things that happen in your life that you turn into what-ifs and scenarios?_

My very first post on 200WaD \[Joseph and the Poets\]... I started that one on the cuff and it kind of developed into something and I decided to stick with this theme of normal people developing supernatural powers but to unfortunate effect in their lives. So that's what I've been sticking to in 200WaD fiction, I'm trying to get a collection together but it'll probably be a couple years of work.

_So it sounds like you're trying to get a collection of work. So are you not thinking of editing/revising while collecting? Or are you thinking of doing that together?_

No. I am totally thinking of editing and revising while writing new material.

_So 200WaD is more akin to a blog right now. Would you also be publishing that also elsewhere?_

Eventually that would be the goal, yes. I don't know where that might be. I'm a little hesitant to self-publish or even aspire to publish in print. 

_Yeah could you talk about that hesitance? I think a lot of people here could relate._

Yeah there's just so much text in the world already. And I actually had this conversation last night and the person encouraged me not to think this way. 

In especially fiction. And especially unpublished aspiring people... self publishing... There's the occasional success story. But there's just a lot of stuff out there. I will get a lot of feedback from authors I admire first before I would throw my hat into the ring.

_Even if it were to throw your hat in the ring in a self-published manner, you'd want that feedback first?_

Yes.

_So it's really cool that even with this hesitance, it still hasn't slowed you down or deterred you from writing._

I'm writing for myself primarily. It's a satisfying creative outlet for me. It fulfills a part of my existence that I require to be fulfilled that's kind of laid dormant for awhile. After writing I got into writing a lot of music for ten, fifteen years. But then I got too busy with my day-job and kid to work on music very much, it's a little more time consuming and requires more quiet, which is hard to come by in my house. So music kind of has gone to the wayside for a bit, and saw the opportunity to... I think I wrote about it on 200WaD.. I tried 750 words a day in the past, and it was too much. I couldn't dump 750 words in a day, like I'd always fall 250 words short or so. But 200 words is a really sweet spot where even it's the end of the day and I'm pretty beat, I can manage 200 words about something. It's not always fiction because that takes a little more work. Except for yesterday when I forgot entirely cause I had a house show here last night.

_Yeah with 200 words a day, you can totally manage the time everyday, but sometimes there are these social tsunamis where it becomes less about time and more attention and focus._

Yes. Now I have a calendar event every night to both read and write, I'm trying to re-focus on getting more reading done. So I have an hour bundled everynight, but last night that houseshow blew right through that hour and then I didn't even think about it again until this morning.

_Must've been a good concert._

It was. And it was a social event.

_So when you had to pick between music and writing, you mentioned the benefits of writing being a lower barrier to entry like noise and setup._

Yeah exactly, like I don't have the space to record demo songs like when I was single living in a two bedroom duplex, where one bedroom was a office/studio. And I can't really get a long chunk of time to work on a song. Cause that is even more iterative. You'l find a chord progression. Then you'll find the lyrics and put them together. And if you can't do it everyday, then you lose whatever it was, even if you write it down and record it.

_Yeah I think I know what you mean! Like you need to be a certain Daniel Miller... a certain feeling to stick with that chord progression and feeling in the lyrics. And if you take a day off or two then you can lose that feeling?_

Exactly.

_Oh man... You think that's the same with writing? Or is writing more insulated from temporal expiration?_

I think it's similar but not as pronounced. So I will often have to go back and re-read back a few posts on my fiction to make sure that I'm back mentally in the story, but that's not as hard as having to listen to a recording on my phone, re-figure out the chord progression and get back into the headspace of whatever it was that inspired all that. 

I enjoy spontaneous writing like my first story on 200WaD, but for the most part it has to be more planned out, and then it's easier to get caught back up to wherever I was. Although I'm having a really hard time putting the final post or two on this vampire story.

_Oh yeah. I just got caught up on that. With reading fiction for me, I cannot ... like when someone's writing nonfiction like Keni I can read it everyday, but with fiction I cannot just read one post a day. I need to wait and binge at once. So I actually waited until today to finish the second half. But yeah. Cliffhanger!_

Yeah sorry about that. It should be done by now. But the way you read fiction is probably true for most of us. Because it's harder to pick back up on a 200 word chunk wherever the story left off, especially if I'm waiting a week between writing a fiction posts, which has been the case for me more often than not lately. So I'm trying to get back into the groove.

_Would you say those time between fiction posts has something to do with your headspace in relation to your life like family and work._

It's a little bit that. And in this case it's a little bit more the difficulty of making sure there is continuity, and also not having... because there's a set endpoint and I didn't know how I was going to get to that endpoint, but I need to get there with continuity. That's what made it more difficult. Had made me have to think about it.

_Often times a thing to consider is since you're just collecting the story right now, you could begin closer to the endpoint, because me as a reader I won't be mad that you didn't do the continuity from where you are now to the next, because I know I'm walking with you as you write this. And in the revised version it can fit more together._

Yeah. I have considered letting more rough drafts out. But it's already a rough draft, but I'm already so bad at editing that I figure I need to get as close on the first draft because it might be a while before I have time to come back around to make it better on the second draft.

_Back to that headspace thing. I think that anything that gets you to be able to be in the headspace to write more frequently would be a good thing for the first draft._

Yeah for sure.

_This is just me as the fan speaking. Because I just want more._

I promise to.. especially once I get done with the Kipper story, because it's close. I'm actually debating just writing one more post to wrap it up.

_You mean a final thing that just sums everything up really quick?_ 

Yes. Ha. 

_Hahaha._

Skipping most of the second half of the current century basically.

_Right, it's like nothing happened!_

Or everything's terrible!

_Everything is Madmax!.So you're in Dallas, Texas. I have no idea what the climate is like, but I always hear Texas is hot. Are things related to climate change pretty pronounced there?_

Not anymore pronounced than elsewhere. Maybe less pronounced since we're not near an ocean. So we don't have any hurricanes or rising sea levels on the mind... or earthquakes, although earthquakes aren't related to climate change. But the climate's pretty temperate. It just cooled off. It does get very hot in the summer. Just in the past few days did it cool off, but it cooled off a lot. Ha. So we're kind of losing spring and fall here.

_Same here. The reason I keep bringing that up is not because I'm trying to pigeonhole you into being an activist. But I think I see more the climate creeping into the stories on 200WaD. Like SaraSilva wrote about her parents/grandparents writing about finally caving in and getting an air conditioner. Stuff like that. When I'm reading your Joseph and the Poets, I notice a lot of references to coffee and laptops, and that's the kind of stuff I like writing about. So it's interesting to see worldly things like the climate creeping into the stories._

Yes, it's definitely top of mind, but I do have a bit of a dormant activist streak in me. Back in 2001 I was writing a lot about that kind of stuff.

_Oh yeah, this description of I am Activist definitely makes it seem like an activist piece for sure._

Yeah, that one was a little weird. I tried to inject it with my particular... more rebellious activist bent at the time, but on my blog I was writing a lot of stuff. That time was when the Iraq war was kicking off, and I was in DC for some of that. Went to some anti-war protests and blogged about that. I was taking more photos at the time so I was posting photos of the protest, that kind of thing.

_Yeah sounds like it was a very monumental into building the current Daniel Miller._

Yeah I feel like things are so bad right now, haha, that I've kind of become a nihillist about it, but we'll see if we can..

_Haha, so from your perspective do you feel like it's gotten that much worse?_ 

I mean I'm like of two minds. Cause like politically, the U.S is completely sideways, and I can't really comprehend how we as a people have let it come to this. And there seems to be a lot of us sitting by the sidelines trying not to look at the news, but when we do we're in bafflement of how it could be so terrible. Still yet plowing forward as if none of this was really happening or just forgetting what the last thing that was happening because the next thing is so terrible in comparison.

_So we're a country full of a nihillist? Just kidding._

I'm definitely more of a nihilist about it. haha.

_So do you really feel like it has actually gotten worse? Or are you just saying that?_

Right, so I think statistically things have gotten better worldwide. I think. There's some good blogs out there that accentuate how things have gotten better out there. There's a newsletter that highlights how things have gotten better. I forgot what it's called. The Future maybe? I unsubscribed because it got too long and I had to cut my list, but that one was really good. So I think statistically poverty and hunger are getting better and health is getting better worldwide. So I think there is reason to be optimistic. Part of me, feels like this is the last throughs of some disease you know? When you're sick and you start to feel better and at the last second it makes a short comeback and you get well. I feel like this is that last second attempt by some social illness to exert itself. And hopefully we make it to the other side.

_Right. So the statistics you're speaking of... I'm optimistic in that regards too actually. But I've been more pessimistic, not because of social statistics, but the physical constraints of living on this earth with limited resources. Oh no! The earth's resources... it's more dire._

It is pretty dire. And for awhile you know, I thought the human race has been very inventive and maybe we can escape this velocity towards global death that we're on with technology. But I'm a little more pessimistic about that. I think I put something on that on the Kipper series about planting trees into old corn fields. Something like that.

But I just wonder if there's ever going to be a tipping point where we take dramatic action or not. Or if there will be a tipping point and everything just melts.

_Yes. Melt. Madmax.So as a CTO of Modern Message for over six years, you've been successful enough to survive this long. And you know how certain startups have negative margins? Where every customer they obtain they lose money. But I feel like with technology, all the technologies meant to save us is more akin to that. Where it comes with more problems. But who knows!_

I think that might be the trap. Because we need to be careful to find solutions that  are actually effective and don't have side effects, but that's hard to know until those side effects starts to manifest in the real world. Te same thing in software right? You add a feature that creates a bug somewhere in the system, and sometimes that bug is worse than the feature.

_Okay now we gotta get back to writing cause otherwise Keni and them will kill me, Seun would like it if we just talked about technology but. If you were able to be one of the seven writers of I am Relevant with its call for authors. Then that must mean you must've had a catalogue. Not just someone with a empty blog with only a 'hello world' post. So I think a lot of people on 200WaD would be interested in your first foray in writing in different avenues._

Sure, but I think both those books were more through luck than anything. That first book was just through my company so that was an opportunity through my day job. And for I am Relevant, I mean yeah I had some stuff to point them to, but they weren't... well at this point, or some point between that point and now they became a big publisher but at the time this was like their first book or something. And they were just a christian music website, and it was their first foray into publishing. So the bar was really low for that. And... back then if you self published on the internet at all, that was unusual. So if you had any kind of writing published on the web that set you apart by itself. Now it's like everyone publishes on the web, now I think you need to have something of substance. And you can still do it self-published, but you'd have to have some substantial audience.

My blog did have a decent audience at the time. Again there was less competition for that audience. And my life was more interesting at the time.

_Right, you were like in Bosnia for like two years?_

Yeah that's when I had the most readers. I had like 1,500 readers a day. 

_That's really good!_

I was writing about the process of preparing to move to Bosnia and my experiences over there but that was pretty short lived. And so that was pretty much the apex of the blog around 2003.

_Yeah I was reading that portion of the blog because I love reading blog posts by older people written when they were around my age. I've done that with people like DHH, and I don't know if you follow his blog, maybe because you're in the technology field, but I went back and read his blog written when he was my age._ 

_But with the 1,500 readers thing and the fact that simply having a web presence back then setting you apart, I'm glad  you caveated that fact. Because I didn't think about that, because now like you said it's much different. Back then you needed some technical savvy to get on and write on the web right?_

That's right. Yeah. I mean Blogger existed. Wordpress was just starting out. So there were some keyturn solutions. But there just weren't as many people doing it. I just don't think it'd entered the consciousness as much. And it was a real golden era. Because it was relatively a smaller community than today. So when I bump into someone, like I just bumped into someone here who just started at Modern Message who was an early blogger as well and we were reminiscing about early tech blogs. And there's so much good nostalgia for that era when it was new and innocent... pre social-media you know?

_Maybe you all didn't know each other intimately, but there were familiar faces and avatars? Because everyone had their own homegrown blogs._

Yeah there was probably a top-100 and there was the long tail of the rest of us who could have a decent audience but nothing like those top 50 or 100. But if you namedrop any one of those with someone else who's was around in that era it'll create an immediate touch point with that person if you could namedrop one of those top 100 people.

Name dropping those people will immediately elicit the golden age. Which is funny because it's basically the web-equivalent of being an old man. We're just aging ourselves haha. like "Back in my day! There were only 10 thousand blogs!"

_Exactly. I remember the first post I read by you was one about 'what happens to our websites after we die'. I really liked that article because I've been to some websites belonging to people who passed away, and their family will have put up some kind of message notifying visitors that the author has passed away. And I feel there's something more tragic about wondering what happens to a personal blog as opposed to what happens to their facebook account._

Yeah absolutely. this is the kind of thing that might've been on paper before, and it might slowly deteriorate or be lost or end up in the back of a storage unit somewhere. But now if the harddrive dies or becomes inaccessible, or the webserver bills stop being paid, it's gone.

So that post was about a particularly weird instance. Because the domain expired and some person with the same name picked it up and then the RSS feed stayed the same. So I got a new RSS post in my RSS Reader like a year after the blog owner died and so for a split second it was like he was speaking from beyond the grave. And then when I clicked through I realized this was something completely different. and there was this very harsh reality that the world moves on... you know?

_That just gave me chills. you know right before you brought up the harsh reality part. that is a very good beginning to a fictional book. But in the book the harsh reality doesn't come until later. Doesn't come instant._

Yeah. Oh that's good! Who's going to write that? You or --

_You! It's your life!_

Or we can write it together! ha.

_It's gotta be you. Cause you know the feeling. When you explained that feeling to me when the sudden a year after your friend's death a RSS ping came through the feed, I can feel it. If I were to write it, the reader wouldn't feel it cause I didn't feel it._

I'm capturing that right after the call. I'm going to give you credit!

_Okay let's wrap this up then! So you can stay in this headspace. So what are your goals moving forward, and not just moving forward but in the present and past couple months. Like what does writing mean to you, Daniel Miller?_

My goal is to just keep doing it. And that's again why I like 200WordsADay so much, because it puts a goal that I can achieve in front of me everyday, and it allows me to make some progress, because that's all my current schedule really allows. What I found at the beginning of the year right around when I discovered 200WaD... I thought this could work. And I just started doing it and the mental health benefits was pretty profound. 

It was the same thing when our kids let out and I decided I was going to start riding my bike again, it was the same thing. The mental health benefits were apparent, and I was just like I need to keep being able to do this.

So those two things, it's really about the short-term benefits to my own health, both physically and mentally -- in the case of writing.

_Yeah it's so important that you point that out. Cause I think that we all have that in us. Because it might not be so obvious. Might be subconsciously the driver._

Yeah and being a creative person has always been a core part of my identity, and recently because of family and work the creative part of my life has become more dormant like I explained with the music getting on the backburner. And that's been a real shame and so like 200WaD has been a really great vehicle to express myself creatively again. That's something I need. It's like my soul needs to be able to do that whether or not people read it or whether or not it reaches a wider audience or not. It's just something I need to do. I need to produce some creative work for my own self.

_Yeah that's so good. Thanks for coming back over and over again. Cause on 200WaD it's either like #TeamStreak you're hardcore streaking or you miss a streak and you never come back. But you're one of the few where you have moments of dipping out but you always come back._

Yes. I wrote about that at one point. Because it can't be all or nothing for me, cause then it'll be nothing cause it's not everything. I do get a little resentful of the chicken coming out of the icon next to my profile when I do skip a day. Cause it's like "I'm not a baby chicken! I just skip a day here and there by accident." But I've gotten over it and ... you know? 

In fact this morning when I'd realized yesterday, I was like I'm going to write right now, but all I wanted to write about was why I skipped, and I don't want to write another meta post haha!

_Yes! haha. A lot of posts are meta posts. Like contemplating the streak and justifying the streak and why it's okay or not okay to break it._

Haha. Yeah and I think that's okay. Because the community is it's own unique thing. And that's another aspect I like about the site. Because of the community that has evolved around it. Because you can find this about myself really quickly on my blog, because I'm pretty anti mass-socialmedia but pretty pro small online communities, you know relatively speaking small. So I am anti Facebook and Twitter and super pro sites like 200WordsADay.com for the same social elements, but I just think it's not the type of thing that can scale to Facebook size you know? But I think it's really beneficial at a smaller scale like 200WaD or even something bigger could work, I think you just need to be careful and intentional about building that community. Like if you solve for growth like Facebook did, then you can't be intentional about the community and then you have terrible things happening. Ha. I don't think we need to get into that.

_Yes. We've already talked about all this other bad stuff so let's not get into it! So final thing, Baz is the creator of this so if you had a request for him to help make 200WaD more fulfilling for you what would be that request? And also what would you request of yourself to help make 200WaD more fulfilling for others._

I would focus on keeping it simple and focusing on the core value propositions. And I would focus on how best to enable the community that's developed there. I'm short on good ideas. But I do think focusing on making the current experience better as opposed to maybe adding new features is I think a key thing.

_So value prop. For Daniel Miller what is the value prop that you'd want Baz to laser in on?_

Providing a good writing environment and reading environment. 

_Yes reading environment! That's the one thing I want him to focus on, so here's two votes!_

And as far as what I can contribute, I need to keep coming back. I need to stay disciplined and when I do miss a day like yesterday I need to make sure I come back the next day and not let it turn into a week long thing. And I have to participate. Like a lot of days I only have 15, 30 minutes to write and I don't get to read other people's posts. And that's really a shame. 

When I do have time I try to focus on people I follow so I try to read them first, but if you go to the following tab and you go to a post, and then you go back, then you're no longer on the following tab... that kind of thing. Also you can only go so far back on the following tab, there's no pagination or something like that.

_Yeah low hanging fruit. And for me I'm a big fan of collections. Like your Kipper and Joseph collections. I would want more ability to be able to navigate next and previous between posts within a collection. Right now I need to use like two tabs._

Right. Like you said, it seems like it's low hanging fruits, because it has to do with navigational elements on certain collections or a collection of your following writers' most recent posts.

And RSS feeds. This is my old schoolness coming out. If I could have an RSS feed of the people I follow or a particular collection then that would be amazing because that would pop up on my feedreader as I open it. I don't follow that many blogs so that would get posts in front of me more that way.

_Wow that's so oldschool didn't think about it. But RSS is a really good idea._

Maybe RSS feed or an API endpoint for those kinds of things and let other people build it. The API is key because I wrote that script to backup my 200WaD, cause if I couldn't back it up I would've probably bailed by now because I'd be too nervous that everything's going to disappear.

_Yeah I'll put a link to that repository for backups. But not everyone is a developer, so maybe we need to make a simple SASS for it... I mean a free thing cause it's so simple._

I agree. Totally agree.

_Yes, and that backup just turns it into a TXT file?_ 

Yes, It does a tiny bit of html stripping to make it more palatable as a text file. But again, because my use-case was just to capture my fiction, for my other posts if I have a bunch of other links it's not such a big deal for me to lose those things.

_Awesome. Thank you so much for this conversation I know you're so busy like you said you had to even give up your love of practicing music everyday, but thank you for getting on this call._ 

Yeah absolutely! It was a pleasure. 

_And we'lll continue discoursing on the website and I really look forward to all this new fiction. And also I'm looking forward to you starting a story based on the start being an RSS feed pinging you from the death._

Awesome. I'm going to start that right now.

_Enjoy your Sunday!_

You too! And thank you for the encouragement.

_Okay bye!_

Bye!
