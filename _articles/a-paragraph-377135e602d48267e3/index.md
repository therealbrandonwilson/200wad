At Normands I couldn’t find Jeannie in the patio. It sunk my heart a little and even made me consider going to Rust to grab a drink instead. The thought of fizzy, cold beer flooding my mouth as I listened to people chatting up the bartender, complaining about their boss or landlord filled me with a warm sense of belonging. I pictured the bar, sunlight pouring in — just the right amount — so that it didn’t feel so depressing given how early it was. But as I stood at the crosswalk listening to the robotic voice say WAIT… WAIT… every couple seconds,  I turned around, resolutely decided to go into Normands anyways. I would grab a coffee, or actually a cappuccino. And I’d sit and drink it real slow. After that, then I could see how I feel and go to Rust if I still felt the urge to go. The music poured into my ears even before I opened the door. My hand stuck to the thick, golden knob for a moment more than appropriate while I gazed at myself in the glass. Once I was inside I found Jeannie seated in the furthest corner.
