> All returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.

\-- Naval

  

When I first got here, it was about posting everyday and keeping the flame alive. And then I lost the flame, and then it became about getting my post counts high.

When I was first getting settled here, I would read others posts in a timely manner and comment right away. And then I would hope for a comment back soon.

After I was situated here, I no longer read as vigilantly based on time. I more batched my reads per writer and would save their posts until a certain day. And I felt less obligated to comment. It made me happy enough to just know that I read their post and that they were continuing their writing. They didn't need my comments. And more and more, I'm feeling that feeling here.

Now that I'm set here, I feel like my relationships with people here are no longer a thing that could be undone with one week of inactivity. Now it is a longwinded orbital relationship.

Sure there are a lot of people who drop out early. But there are plenty who've stayed a long time. And they make this place feel like a group marathon.
