He couldn't take any photos feeling this way. Instead he looked through old photos of her through the tiny display while rubbing his hand across the concrete ledge of the parking structure that looked cold but felt lukewarm.Â 

She had been wearing a maroon American Apparel hoodie. You couldn't see her legs, or even the lower portion of her torso but you could tell that she was tall. He liked that about her. It made for good images. He found it remarkably unfair that tall girls looked great in photos even when you couldn't see their stature. How unfair, but it was good to be on the right side of an unfair world. As in good to be dating her. Or have dated her.

The overcast sky and looming warmth had done him in. He wouldn't have guessed it when leaving the house for the 40 minute drive, but now that he was here, the lighting, ambiance, and the empty concrete parking structures of late summer afternoons had forced him into a nostalgic paralysis. He lacked an imagination so much that he believed that his unhappiness came from the fact that he was no longer with her.
