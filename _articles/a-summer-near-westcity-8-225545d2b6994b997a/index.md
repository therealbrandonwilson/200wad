Because the Art Fair is still happening, I decide to spend today doing nothing. I don't even plan on bringing my phone, because then all I'd want to do is check what she is doing in Europe. Instead, I figure what's best for me is to aimlessly walk around listening to my old iPod touch.

  

The battery's dead, so I plug it in while eating a bowl of peanut butter and banana, but after two bowls, I'm stuck pacing around the apartment until I grow so anxious that I need to take off with a 20 percent charge.

The song selections are from freshman year; the soundtrack to my past life, although it's not that many years away; and that soundtrack now barely means anything, besides acting as a reminder to how naive I was. Listening makes my insides sink, and barely a few minutes into the walk, I remove the earbuds. The sounds of the Art Fair start flooding in, and I feel like I've emerged out, from under water.

Sounds of people. What are they doing? I don't know. What the hell is anyone doing? Why fuck are we all gathered around these things called cities? I stop into a Chipotle an hour later and order a chicken bowl togo with a tortilla shell on the side. While watching the guy wrap the aluminum top over my bowl, I wonder what the hell is he doing here. Why is he spending his time preparing food for people like me. _why are you fucking wasting your life?_

After devouring the food outside under an umbrella, I throw everything away and head onto campus.
