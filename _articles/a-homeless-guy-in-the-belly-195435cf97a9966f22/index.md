Koreans have very literary ways of saying things. A very funny saying my dad once uttered:

"Do you have a bum in your belly?"

describes someone with insatiable hunger.

In Korean, the word _bum_ or _homeless person_ is derogatory in an absolute-normative way without the same political charge it carries in the U.S. _Homeless_/_bum_ in Korean always paints a man in my imagination rather than my English evoked conception of _homeless people_ which encompasses both genders, albeit a higher proportion of men.

I pondered aloud about this saying while at the bdinner table when my mom commented how fast we went through food -- both my brother and I were visiting. I asked, why it is that the phrases uses _bum._ My mom and dad both said it was because _bums_ go long periods without eating and will wolf down food when given the chance. Thus if a _bum_ lives in your belly, you will always be hungry, no matter how much you eat, because that _bum_ will eat it himself.

To that I asked why that _bum_ was always hungry. "Wouldn't it eventually stop being hungry and not wolf down food?"

My dad snickered and said, "In this metaphor, this bum is always a bum and always hungry as a bum."

As my mom laughed at this, I suggested that perhaps the _bum_ inside the belly had a _bum_ within his own belly. I then asked, if you think that the universe is just _bums_ within the bellies of other larger _bum_ organisms.
