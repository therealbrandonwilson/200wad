Responding to one of Keni's comments on here.

She and Seun are adept at complimenting you. It really puts a smile on your face. And just like some people just can't handle how good alcohol feels, I can't handle compliments. Not saying that I'm against compliments from these two in particular, I'm just using them as an example because... well when you talk about alcoholics you usually don't think of beer or wine, but that strong, hard liquor.

I'm your typical ENFP. And my god, do compliments make me feel good. But I've had a huge chip on my shoulder since I got out of college. I've hated that I was such a sucker for feeling good. So I've been superimposing now for years the drive to get more out of life than feeling good. 

I know a lot of self conscious people, and those are the people I think who need the compliments. Some of my nervous, introverted -- yet still social -- friends can't do or perform at their best unless people palpably let them know that they're appreciated. 

But with me, compliments just make me feel like everything's alright, driving me to complacency and I end up not doing anything. 

I'm not too good for compliments, I'm too weak to handle them.

  

Btw, love that I'm no longer using @keni or @seun. Just like using their names. This was inspired by seeing Keni use Mine and Gabriel's name without the @sign haha #teamCommunity !!

_Thank you both for the compliments. But compliments are bad for my character so this will be the last time I respond to compliments. I don't want you to think that I dislike them, it's just that I know they are bad for me! So long complimenter Keni and Seun!!!_
