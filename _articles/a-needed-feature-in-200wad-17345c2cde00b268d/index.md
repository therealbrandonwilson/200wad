If you're already working on this @basilesamel, then sweet! If not, I think this is a needed feature.  

A lot of people such as myself and @timsubiaco are writing posts daily as part of a larger chronological work. There is a way to hashtag the category of each posts, but none to group them as part of a planned singular work.

When publishing and also retrospectively with published posts, writers should be able to assign the _post_ to a piece of _work_. For example, Tim might create a work called 'The Ballerina: A Painfully Modern Tale of Love, Confusion and Hope" and then be able to arrange all the posts already written for his novella in the right order. Right now, Tim is currently makeshifting it by redundantly titling his posts with the title of the novella each time.

Having a _works_ feature will also provide the reader a better user experience. While reading a _post_ that is part of a larger _work_ they should easily be able to navigate previous and next within posts of that same body of work. Right now, I need to return to Tim's profile and figure out which post I was reading, locate the next or previous one that I want, and click on it. 

This website has drastically lowered my barriers to writing daily. And I think it's also important to reduce the barriers for reading other fellow writers' works.

  

Updated/Added:

  

I think that this would also be a good differentiator for free vs pro accounts.

  

Free can have up to 2 or 3 maybe works.  

While Pro can have unlimited.
