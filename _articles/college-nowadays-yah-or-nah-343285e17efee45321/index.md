Brea speaks about the different possibilities she's been running through her head. It seems like she's not going to miss the store at all. It even feels like she's blaming this job as reason for not getting on with her life. One of her options is going to school.

But you know I don't know. Not fully sold. School these days. Doesn't have the same rep, you know? I mean like when's the last time you hear someone rave about their education? 

Mm. You got me there. But I barely talk to college kids. 

Yeah. Well take my word for it. They don't like it. Not the school part at least. But I mean a lot of them like the partying, but then that's not what you really pay 20 grand a year for am I right? But then again, I know a lot of kids who go and live in a college town you know, while going to the community college and trying to hang out with the university kids, but it never really works out. There's something about having to be going through the same thing. So I take back what I said. It's not the partying that the kids like. It's the social life! You like that Ivan?

You've been thinking a lot about this?

Oh come on! Don't you ever wish you ever went to school?

Hey wait! I thought you did go to school?

I did. But only for one full semester. I couldn't make it past spring. Had to drop out. But now I think I might be ready. I feel different now.

Mm. Yeah well I know for sure I don't want to go to school right now. But you're not wrong about me sometimes wishing I had gone.

Oh yeah? How so?

I'd be such a different person if I'd gone. I'd be getting out with a degree right now. I'd had my degree for a year. Who knows I might've been in California for the past year. Or New York. Somewhere.

You don't like it here?

What's to like?

That's so cliche, Ivan. 

The door opens. And the unmistakable smell of Ivan's roommate bursts into the store.
