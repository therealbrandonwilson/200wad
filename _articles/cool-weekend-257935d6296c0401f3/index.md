Yesterday, after weeks of hot humidity, I was taken aback by the autumn-like air when it hit me as soon as I stepped outside. I went back in, not to fetch my sweatshirt since I already have two of those in the car, but to open the windows before heading to the Farmer's Market.

This is the second week with no official farmer's market. Rather there are two separate ones, both claiming to be anti-hate or hate-free markets. I go to the unofficial market that is being held in the previous official location, because that's where my bakery is with the freshest foccacia available. 

Almost a month back the city suspended the market citing safety concerns from rising political tensions. You can go read about it, just search _bloomington indiana farmer's market suspension_. 

Because of all this, I like going early in the morning, right when it opens. Then, it feels just like a Farmer's Market. Less cops. Less protesters. Just vendors, customers, and the odd musician. 

The students began trickling in the past week, but it's been since Friday that they are back in bloom: their furniture all moved in and able to wander around seeking experiences and meaning. They along with this cool autumn like air make walking around campus a pleasure. I don't think I walked the campus for pleasure once this summer. But now that the stars have aligned, it's quite nice. With my backpack on, I look just like one of them. I blend in.

Who know's how long this fraction within the Farmer's Market will last. Hopefully not long. Everytime I return with a fresh pan of Focaccia, my girlfriend remarks of how interesting of a town we live in. I say, yes... it's almost like we are in a movie or a tv show. And then we dip the bread into olive oil specifically selected from Italian vendors; I'm serious she spent like hours on this selection. 

And then we drink espresso along with carbonated water. 

In about two hours, I'll be heading to a neighborhood meeting. I've never been to one before, but I saw a sign for it while taking a walk the other day. We live in a nice neighborhood here, probably the best one. And so I'm interested in seeing what they do at these meetings. I know that just like I can blend in while wearing a backpack, I can blend in as a community loving adult who has concerns over real issues. Honestly, I'm just curious though. Plus it's being held at the school that they move the Farmer's Market into during the winter, when it's too cold to do things outside. 

Yes. It's a very cool weekend. I don't know how long it'll last. The hot humidity will return for sure before we enter the true fall. I thought about checking the data... weather reports for when that might be happening. But then I wrote this instead. I hope you're having a great weekend yourself, whatever the weather might be like where you are.
