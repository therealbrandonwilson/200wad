Harry was glad that his palms weren't sweaty. As they stepped into the forest, he hadn't mentioned anything to Harry. Jake just hoped he be able to make it out of the forest not too sweaty. He could change his clothes later alone.

But his palms were still relatively dry. Maybe it was because Harry was leading the way and he knew this place. Maybe it was the unofficial trail they were walking. The trail was unofficial as in unmarked, but the type where it was obvious that hikers frequented it. It was too comfortable to walk for it not to be.

"You see that?" Harry pointed ahead while leaning out of the way.

"Mm. Paper?"Jake said.

The two of them approached carefully, as though a piece of paper could present danger to two grown men holding guns.

It turned out to be one card from a standard deck of playing cards.Â 

"Four of Hearts." Harry held up to Jake. Then Harry got a plastic bag out for the card.

"Litter patrol?" Jake joked.

"You don't know what might matter."

"Mm."

As they walked deeper into the woods, they found more cards. Three more cards. All fours.
