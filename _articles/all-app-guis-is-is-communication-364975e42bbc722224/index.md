From working on a task scheduling app for my girlfriend, I've finally absorbed the  insight that all information within the GUI is communication. This might sound stupid, because of course everything on a screen should communicate  SOMETHING to the human on the other side! But actually I've spent years building user interfaces knowing this without _knowing_ it.

I've never dedicated long periods to crafting UIs. I don't come from a computer science or software background, so most of my focus was stuck on making the database, server, and the backend code actually work and not blow up, which left me just enough time after getting things _working_ to throw a UI together that looked clean, not beautiful or sleek, but simple and easy to use.

Or so I thought. Until I absorbed this realization. 

So I knew in my head that information on a user interface is meant to communicate something to the user. But seeing how this knowledge didn't affect my practices, it could safely be stated that I didn't _know_ it. What really helped me absorb this though was reflecting on the core point of this task scheduler. 

The point of the task scheduler was to make sure communicate certain things. When beginning the project I didn't think of these certain things as communicative though? I began with my initial practice of just thinking that they were information in the database that would just then be presented through the UI. 

My girlfriend -- who will never be referred to as girlfriend again on here because I'll simply use her name from now on -- Trisha organizes a team that provides prospective grad students to the informatics program a deeper perspective into why they might want to come study here for three to five years. This perspective begs for more than just content from a website or videos. You need to have conversations with people who are currently at the school and doing it to get a sense of what it's like to be here. So the team organizes organizes events like live calls and campus tours, and all of this takes a lot of coordination.

The coordination takes a lot of things into consideration. Things like, how many people are required for a particular event. How many hours has each team member worked; there's a minimum and maximum range that they're supposed to work for a given term. And Trisha was originally going to coordinate all this over Slack and a
