What I love most about this diner is the broken lock on the front door. Rita told me how it broke over a decade back, and the manager had tried getting it fixed, but it was around the Fourth of July so their usual handyman was out of town. But when he returned from vacation his hand and wrist were broken from a motorcycle accident. So what was there to do? The manager would've felt guilty finding another handyman, seeing as this was his go-to guy, not to mention that he ate here all the time. Plus, the diner had been fine going over a week with the broken lock, seeing as the place never closed anyhow, so the manager decided jnother month or two until the handyman could get back at it.

I love this idea of a place that never has to lock its doors, not because it belongs in some utopia where people wouldn't imagine crime, but because there's always something happening inside. Always somebody holding down the fort. There's something to learn from this phenomenon I feel.
