A wry smile unfolds across her face. I’m not sure if it’s because she doesn’t believe me or she’s sincerely amused by our pathetic rate of progress. It’s a nice smile that makes me wonder why she hardly ever smiles. I feel like asking this. Why don’t you smile more? If I were an uninhibited person I would blurt that out now, with nobody beside us inside this lonely cafe. What could I be looking for in response? Probably gratitude for appreciating her smile and thanks for empowering her enough to finally smile more, my compliment was all that she needed to embark on a whole new way to life. But that’s not how things work. My head’s just smart enough to know that. Scenarios that allure me come out of a scene from a rom-com screenplay written by a man who hasn’t had enough real conversations. Of course this screenplay is garbage, the kind rejected before the third page. That’s what my views on life are. Something out of a shitty screenplay not even at the level of a shitty movie. So I keep my thoughts to myself and think about thinking my thoughts. Then, meeting her eyes, I snap out of my brain and return to the cafe, seated diagonally beside Jeannie. I reach for my mug and take the last sip of dregs. I think about telling her what I actually want to say. Not that she has a nice smile, but the actual thing that I came down to Normands for.
