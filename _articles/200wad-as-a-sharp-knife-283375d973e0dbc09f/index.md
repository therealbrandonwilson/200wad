When I first started at 200WaD, it was easier to write about my life and thoughts on the community itself. Nonfiction felt so much easier that I had made an early decision to use 200WaD as a documenting tool while I wrote fiction offline. 

Not much later I changed my mind and began throwing fiction on here in between the documenting. At this point, I had still been writing the fiction offline -- in Scrivener -- first and then copying and pasting to the editor. 

Back then my process for fiction differed. I was treating it as something that should be somewhat good and valuable to a reader before I posted it. This was back when Gabriel Greco was still here. Back when I posted fiction hoping somebody would read it. 

What I noticed after being on here awhile was how fast my nonfiction was improving. Not just the quality of the output, but more importantly the seamlessness of the process. I examined my nonfiction process and compared it to my fiction process and saw that I was approaching things backwards. 

I was deploying a proven process for long-term progress and creation to something that was only meant to document the exact thing I was actually trying to create long-term. The nonfiction was only meant to highlight and share my forays into my actual craft, fictional storytelling, but I was focusing more on the documenting than the actual work. Focusing too much on the sharing than the actual creating. 

So somewhere along the line I said fuck it, this process is too good not to apply to my actual craft. So I started writing fiction just like I was writing nonfiction. Which is just going straight to 200WaD editor and writing straight into it. Sometimes I won't post. Sometimes, I'll go back to something old and edit it. 

But everytime I post, I don't expect what I'm posting to be cemented and finalized. It's a living organism that breathes as a part of the long-term creation, and so it doesn't have to be good. It just has to be done.

So here's a little bit of documenting on here for what I've been doing with my craft. 

  

TLDR:

I found a really really sharp knife -- for me that is writing straight into 200WaD without expecting anybody to read it -- but I noticed that I was only applying it to documenting my craft rather than the actual craft. I finally found that this was ridiculous and decided to take that sharp knife and use it on my craft as well,
