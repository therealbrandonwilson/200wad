Just got to my friend Joel's house in Baltimore. Hilarious thing they have is an entire box of Amazon prime plantain chips. 

It made me laugh hard. Theres things in the big city that just crack me up now. Like boxes of bags of Amazon prime chips. I can hear Jeff Bezos laughing with his sockless feet on top of an Amazon basics desktop.

  

I hope that Amazon takes over the world. They really do a good job of delivering things on time. And arent we all sick of politicians making promises they cant keep? Well let's just let Amazon take over the world and we will no longer need to worry about anything because everything we need will be just two hours away. 

I'm really sick of all these people complaining about the social effects of Amazon! Like that's the cost of two hour shipping! Free 2 hour shipping ain't free!

So whatever happens with this country I think the most bestest thing we can hope for is that the corrupt government keep their fingers out of Amazon. Please do not break up big tech. In fact we need more trillion dollar companies and Amazon should be a 100 trillion dollar company!
