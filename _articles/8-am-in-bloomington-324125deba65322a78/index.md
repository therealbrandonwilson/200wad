Didn't have a clean thermos to put it in so I left the coffee in the Bialetti when we headed out.

Roads were empty. Clean drive. Dropped you off and came back home in record time. 

Farmer's market is now under winter location, and also winter hours. Still have an hour until it opens. 

The coffee was still between warm and hot. Soda water you'd poured still just enough carbonation. 

Just read a Brian Ball post that made me feel a type of way. A good way. Hopeful way.

  

Not just long ago I felt compelled to go to a coworking space or cafes to get my work done. My idea of being productive was taking my laptop to one of the above places and hammering away. Only that, once I got there I really struggled to do the work. But it was much easier to do it there than it was at home.

Recently one of the most novel things in my life is the ability to work at home. Usually when someone says they have the ability to work at home, it means they have a remote job. In my case I don't mean that. I mean that I can finally wake up and just get to work at home. I don't need to prepare myself to go someplace or get in a state of mind. 

Just as an exhausted person can simply fall into slumber, I can fall into work. At any time. No more ramping up. No more cafes or co working spaces. I used to dream of being here but I never thought I'd ever actually be like this.
