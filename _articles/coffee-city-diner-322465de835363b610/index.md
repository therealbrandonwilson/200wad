Thought there wasn't no American flag in sight, the Coffee City Diner was truly American. The red, white, and blue flowed through the silver water taps, the veins in the rippling forearms of the cooks and waitresses, and in the freshly burnt coffee.

Americans look down upon frills, but fall heavy for them when they feel just too good to be true. The gold rush, the tech bubble, the real estate speculation market, bitcoins. All huge in America. But when it comes to food, there is little frill seeking amongst the sludge blooded working class of these United States.

When you're doing hard, honest, labor for above eight hours a day, sometimes days away from the same family you're providing a livelihood for, then you ain't got time for kale or quinoa. When you get a break to eat then you want that meal to be big so you don't leave the joint feeling an ounce of hunger. And you don't want it to cost an arm and a leg.Â 

Enter, the American diner. Cheap, high calorie food, that fuels the working foundation of this great country. Order slabs of meat alongside eggs, and buttered, starchy toast. And guzzle it down with hot, black coffee. So hot that when you guzzle it and feel the burn in your throat, it reminds you that you need to get back to work.

Though some diners claim to be a diner, their values aren't reflected so. Where are the value prices? Where are the calories? The Coffee City Diner stays true to the American reality. For people who prefer living over dreaming.
