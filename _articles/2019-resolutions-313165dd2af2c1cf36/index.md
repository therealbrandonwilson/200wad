TLDR: I'm releasing a pack of stories in late December

  

Do I misunderstand the word resolution? In stories I imagine it being the part where the climax is resolved. The ending. And yet people call their New Year's goals resolutions.

Anyways I was about to write of my 2019 closing plans, when I realized that could well be described my 2019 resolutions. How will this year -- and decade btw, yeah scary i know -- resolve. Let me know how you'll be resolving yours.

I often shame 'seun and Keni when they write private posts. But this isn't because I'm inherently against private posts, but rather cause I'm a fan of their content. As a fan I feel cheated when they post on here one day and that one post is a private one. If they'd provided a public post alongside then I wouldn't complain.

But anyways. I've been writing some private posts alongside my public ones. And that's where my 2019 resolutions lay bundled. In the midwestern U.S, the holidays are an emotionally rich time that creates a reflective headspace. And I'm releasing a pack of stories for my fans -- I have two! 'seun and Keni.. the same ones I bash above haha.
