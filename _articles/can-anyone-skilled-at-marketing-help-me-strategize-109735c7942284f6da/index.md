Can anyone help me strategize how to market fiction? A ripe market in digital marketing right now is the sale of self-help products. Whether this be in the form of supplements, education material, or communities of practice, the #1 thing that people seem to be able to sell online in the 2015-2019 epoch seems to be products aimed to improve their life.  

I'm working on a body of fiction. This fiction is not aimed to help people in the same way self-help is. I've always struggled with how one should market such material. When you are marketing a product in a popular domain such as self-help, there is no shortage of excellent examples to learn from.

Fiction prose still markets itself mostly to a target-market of people wanting to read books. Thus they still publish books a traditional way. What I'm trying to figure out is a way to market and distribute fiction in a more 2019 way. Similar to how Amazon and Shopify is the 'now-way' of selling/distributing products, what do you suppose the most 2019 way of distributing and also increasing engagement with fiction is?

What is an example of a 2019 'sales-funnel' for fiction? Right now I am slowly building a tiny email list. On March 11 I'll be submitting the first of many future submissions to a fiction journal.Â 

That is all I got so far. In the future I want to develop a 'fiction-funnel' as effective as self-help funnels that address the customers' immediate problems and offer solutions.
