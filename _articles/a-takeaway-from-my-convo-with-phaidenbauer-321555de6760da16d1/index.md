After being here for almost a year now, I became used to this community. It became a normal thing for me, and when something becomes normal you lose a bit of appreciation. 

Then, while listening to Philipp ( @phaidenbauer ) speak of his appreciation, I was able to feel it again. I think it was because he speaks so straight forwardly, without fluff or niceties so that his words came through unadulterated by my own perceptions of _what is he really saying?_

Might sound odd having me caveat this, but it's cause as an American, I'm used to speaking with fluff and saying one thing but meaning slightly another. This is not me bashing the American way, there is a complexity to it that also results in its own beauty. 

The important thing here is that Philipp's different communication style, for me, allowed myself to be open to the same insights I've been having from a new angle. 

  

**Be true to yourself and tell the story within you**

This isn't a new insight. We all know it's true. But in our actions we deviate. Maybe it's because we feel like ourselves aren't interesting enough. So we get swayed into thinking we need to be another way. And if we work a desk job all day, maybe it's easy to get swayed. That's why it was so illuminating to listen to Philipp and feel his confidence in who he was and what he had to tell.

Philipp's stories comes from his background as a paramedic and technology worker. He doesn't try to be something he's not because there's some cooler positioning out there he saw. He's not a person who's swayed into thinking he wants to be something 'cooler' than a paramedic and wanting to tell that story. He knows who he is.

The takeaway here isn't that he's a cool guy because he's a paramedic with crazy experiences. The takeaway is his confidence, his self awareness of who he is.
