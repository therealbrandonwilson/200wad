It came through email first. I know this with my head, but when reminiscing all that comes to memory is the phone call.

Hi. Long time J. 

Yeah. Hi. So. I guess. I guess..

It's okay, J. Why don't you come back home. 

Yeah I already have my ticket. 

Come back home and we can talk about everything. 

That sounds. That sounds good. 

I was at Sallie's that bright morning. The timing of sunrise was getting real early. And so the city hadn't woken up yet. I felt like I was speaking to the only other person awake in the world, even though the person I was speaking to wasn't in this city but hundreds of miles away. 

I hope you've been doing well, J. It's been a very, very long time. I look forward to seeing you.

On the plane I must've re-read that email several dozen times. The whole time all I could think of was my uncle and the deed to my mom's house, which was quite upsetting because I guess deep down I wasn't that sad about my mom dying. And I knew that that was what I should be feeling at the moment, but while waiting to arrive back home all I could think about was the house. My uncle. His powers. Fuck him.
