He left his apartment he was glad for that. It couldn't be a good day, but given he took that single ounce of action at least meant that it wasn't a terrible one. A pointless one.

One time his mom had wanted to see him while in town. And he couldn't pull himself together to go see her. He had made up some lie about having to study for an important exam and that he simply didn't have the time. She said she understood. That night he just sat inside and drank the rest of his PBR. The next day he would need to go out again to buy more beer.

If there was just a delivery service for alcohol then maybe he would've done himself in. But it's not like he could even afford such. He wouldn't be able to. He had to go pick up his own booze. He couldn't even afford the premium of delivery. He went out and bought Chipotle on days he would go out. On days he would stay in he would subsist on bananas and peanut butter he'd buy at the same convenience stores he bought his booze from.

His apartment had its own in unit washer and dryer. Without that then he would've needed to go to coin laundromat. Maybe that would be good for him. He was beginning to realize that all the niceties in life were actually getting in his way. When was he the happiest? When he was under the microscopic view of his parents. When his entire days were scheduled out to strict time tables and enforced unlike the loose self-moderated schedules of university life. 

He'd go days without speaking to anyone. Interestingly, when someone from his life would happen upon him and he couldn't weasel out of some social situation, the experience tended to leave him with a warm mark. He'd spend the few hours after departing the person thinking that was nice and that he should do that more often. He would even text messages to them saying that they should meet up soon again. And things would seem like they were off to a nice start. Like some new phase of friendship was beginning. 

Friendships seem to happen in waves. As in, there are people in our lives, just waiting to enter and share a part of our experience together, the kind that you look back on and point to as a moment or phase of your life. 

These people of course aren't just waiting there to enter our life. It's not like they're waiting because they have nothing else going on with them, more waiting because there is a relationship, a bond that could be happening, that could just as easily begin the following day, the kind that blossoms into best friendships. But it doesn't. And this possibility is not just there with a single person at a time, but many people, nearly all who've come and gone through our past. Just one random meeting and a hello and a great conversation and then plans to hang out again. And the possibilities are endless. Best friends. Maybe not forever. But for this phase in life. 

For him, the last friend like that had been Trevor. When he thought of Trevor he thought of a better version of himself. A version who didn't exist in the current mindset. One who couldn't imagine that he'd turn out as he is right now. It could be all blamed on Trevor himself. But blaming other people was pathetic. It got you nowhere. So he instead blamed himself. Or the world. Blaming the world was easier than blaming a single person who wasn't himself.
