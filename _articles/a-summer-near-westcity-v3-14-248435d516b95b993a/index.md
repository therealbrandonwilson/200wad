The muted blue I'd woken up to was gone and it was beginning to look like day. I didn't have anyplace to go, it'd be another day without plans. Of course, I knew plenty of things that I _could_ do. I _could_ go look for jobs. I thought of the prospect for awhile before casting it off as something I would do in the future.

Immediately after arriving home I felt like a sack of rocks had been slung over my shoulders. I didn't want to do anything. And the weight kept getting heavier. Soon I would probably be watching meaningless videos on YouTube. Soon.

Using the little gumption I had left, I shot up and dashed out the door. Of all the places not to be, I knew I should be at home right now. But where to go? Where to go?

I puttered around the botanical gardens and Polito trail of the SU campus. Then, once I had an appetite I thought about going into one of the dorm cafs until I casted it off as a horrible idea. Instead, I walked 30 minutes over to that 24/7 diner that I'd gone to for the first time recently.

The waittress was Rita again.

"I thought you work at night?"

"I work all times of day, hun! Black coffee for you?"

I smiled and nodded. She had a sticky menu on my table and a mug of steaming coffee poured within 20 seconds.
