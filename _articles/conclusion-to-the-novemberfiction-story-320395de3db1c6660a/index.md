On Thursday, when Lisa came in early for her shift, there was a package from Ray. Lisa grabbed a letter opener and sliced through the tape. In side was a leather-bound book and a scroll -- of what seemed like rice paper. As she flipped through the book, she admired the sepia-toned pictures of an old Chinese factory with lots of workers handling machines that obviously required arduous labor in uncomfortable conditions. It wasn't a thick book - more of a booklet really - titled The History of Big Sky Manufacturing. It turned out Da Tian -- means Big Sky in Chinese. However, it was the scroll she was curious to open.

Lisa undid the hand-tied string that kept the rolled paper closed. As she unfolded it, she realized the writing on one side was in Chinese characters and the translation to English was on the other.

"It's a poem!" - she said aloud, but in a normal tone of voice. "Joe, come in here, it's a poem."

As she read the poem, she understood the deep connection the Chinese have to life and success.

"Without life, there is no possibility of success. It's not what you add, but what you can happily live without. Living happy means no death." - she said.

"And no death..." Joe thought back - "means no fours?" - he said.

"Yes, Lisa agreed. If we can live without fours, we live without death... is the essence of the poem." she said satisfied.

"It's not about the numbers." Lisa explained, "it's about upholding values - a way of doing business. A philosophy."

She put the book and the scroll on her desk - and got to work. She had a new appreciation for numbers and precision and being thoughtful.

Wow! she thought to herself. If I had never offered to handle the books, I'd never have learned the secret of the four - and a great new insight in how to lead a mindful life. You never can tell how offering to help can change your life.

[Then it started raining. Jack was tired and soaked and increasingly miserable by the minute. Maybe he had made the wrong decision. He contemplated going back and killing those other bigfoot hunters back at the footprint. Too many, too messy, he thought. That's not the way he does things on Thanksgiving.](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca)

[He thought about all of his meticulous planning. About the breaking and entering. The movement through the residence. The method of dispatch. The rituals afterward, ensuring blameless escape. Except for the calling card. A four of any suit. So far he'd used one of each. This year, his fifth, he would have had to choose a suit to use for the second time.](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca)

[Instead, he had chosen to drop it all to pursue his other love, and now he was stuck in the middle of the deep forest, in the rain, his heavy pack isolating back muscles he didn't know he had.](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca)

[He was so distracted by all these mental and physical discomforts that he was almost well into the clearing before he saw it.](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca)

[It was a relatively small clearing, oddly circular in shape. There, nearly across the clearing from him, it loomed. They saw each other at almost the exact same time. Their eyes locked.](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca)

[It was then that Jack realized why he was obsessed. He saw in those eyes the eyes of a monster and the eyes of God. He knew he was looking at himself. They both held expressions of fear and curiosity. Time slowed as to become imperceptible.](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca) 

[Then a rustling and a movement from the corner of his vision grabbed Jack's attention. Two men dressed in uniform pants and what could only be government issue jackets stumbled into the clearing. One of them was pulling a rifle off his shoulder. Through the dim light and mist, Jack squinted, as if suddenly nearsighted. The rifle raised in his direction.](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca)

[He glanced back to the other part of the clearing. The sasquatch was gone.](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca) 

["Damn," he thought as he heard the sound...](https://200wordsaday.com/words/benevolent-large-hairy-creature-7-319535de1edeae58ca)

He still had 3/4 tank of gas when the sign featuring food at the upcoming exit caught his eye. The Coffee City Diner. It wasn't a McDonald's or a Dunkin's. It stood out, which isn't the reason why he'd stopped there on his way up to Clark County just two days earlier.

On his way up, his gas tank had actually been nearing 1/4 full. He never let it drop below a 1/4. So he happened to stop at this sleepy town to fill up. And yes while he was there, he decided to go to the local diner over the McDonald's. But two days earlier he'd failed to notice something. Or not failed... but had no reason to notice something. Exit number 44.

He filled up his tank anyways. It all but costed him eight bucks. Then he pulled into the parking lot of the Coffee City Diner.

Inside he played with the Four of Spade in his hands. Back in Washington, he wondered why Harry had let Jake keep the cards. But now he knew. It all made sense. Everything, even why Harry had called Jake over in the first place. Did Jake feel guilt? He thought about it...

That's when the waitress stopped over, same waitress who'd served him last. The one he wanted to ask the name of. He would've asked this time if it wasn't for the look in her eyes.

Her face still displayed immaculate hospitality. A waitress' smile. It was in her eyes he could see it. A skill he picked up on the job while watching liars of all sorts.

"Nice cards you got there," she said nervous.

Jake had left the other three cards fanned out on the table. He could tell by her half hanging open mouth that she was desperate to see the card he held in his hand. Without thinking, his hand set the four of spade face down, in front of the other three cards... closer to her.

"You can have them if you'd like. I feel... I feel like I'm kind of... I don't know. I'm done with the number four for awhile."

The waitress smiled. Thought about taking the cards... And then after a long second she finally did take them, put them in her apron pocket. She took his order, and then returned to pour him a cup of coffee.

"Thanks," he said.

She walked away quick. Jake Smith was a detective, and thus was paid an unextraordinary salary to sniff out how fear and incentives drove people. The waitress was no hardened murderer. She was an easy read. There was something deep and potentially criminal about whatever it was that his cards had revealed. He could probably easily figure it out if he wanted to. But he was miles and miles away from his jurisdiction. Plus it was none of his business. And finally,

maybe he would rather just get to know her. Ask her her name. Maybe even move out here. He had enough money for two early retired people with heavy hearts and busy minds.

I have been on this search for a while now. After listening to a podcast about love and relationships, everyone talks about how you need to know what you are looking for. Else, how would you know if it is right in front of you.  
  
Here are the details of what I am looking for.  
  
I would like a simple girl. Nothing about drama appeals to me. Nothing. No loca Maria for me. Thank you very much.  
  
I am not into make up. Please reserve that for special occasions - if you have to. Nothing attractive about that to me.  
  
I love a woman that can hold an intelligent conversation. Please don't make me feel like I need to always break things down. Â I can't talk like that for too long.  
  
I would love someone that isn't looking to spend money. I have money.. that is not the issue. But I like to value what I spend it on.

Please no addictions. Not cigarettes, not drugs, no painkillers and definitely not alcohol. I am a health fanatic so I can't have second hand anything. Even love isn't worth that mess.  
  
I would love a woman who knows what she is passionate about. Someone who is into self discovery. That has always been interesting to me.  
  
There - I am putting out what I like and don't like into the universe.  
Time for the law of attraction to start working. Tic Tok universe.
